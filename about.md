My name is Bryan German Pantoja-Rosero, and I am originally from Pupiales, Colombia. 
I hold a PhD in Civil Engineering from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), 
where I also completed a postdoctoral research. My academic background includes a BSc degree in 
Civil Engineering from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNAL) and an MSc in Structures and 
Civil Construction from the Universidade de Brasília (UnB). Currently, I am a postdoctoral 
researcher at the Smart Structures Research Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin.

My research is centered on the application of artificial intelligence, computer vision, machine learning, 
digital twins, extended reality, and physics-based models to address engineering challenges related to construction automation, 
structural health monitoring, and digitalization. I also have experience in finite element methods for modeling 
reinforced concrete and masonry structures . As an educator, I have taught courses at both the bachelor’s and master’s levels,
including differential calculus, mechanics of solids, structural analysis, computational methods, 
research operations, and image processing.

Prior to transitioning into academia, I gained valuable industry experience, working as Chief of Operations 
for road construction and maintenance, as a transportation engineer, and as a field engineer. In addition to my academic 
and industry roles, I co-founded SwissInspect, a company specializing in inspections using image-based technologies.
