My name is Bryan German Pantoja-Rosero, I am 30 years old, and I was born and
raised in Pupiales, Colombia. Currently, I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Earthquake
Engineering and Structural Dynamics (EESD) laboratory at the Ecole Polytechnique
Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). My research focuses on monitoring structural health
using computer vision, artificial intelligence, and physics-based models. In
addition, as part of my entrepreneurial endeavors, I co-founded the imaged-based
inspection infrastructure company SwissInspect, where I serve as chief
technology officer.

I have extensive experience with physics-based micromodeling
of reinforced concrete structures and stones using discrete and finite element
methods. In my experience instructing bachelor's and master's level students, I
have taught differential calculus, mechanics of solids, structural analysis,
computational methods, research operations, and image processing courses. I have
served in the industry as the chief of operations for road construction and
maintenance, a transportation engineer, and a field engineer.
